# Game Server

This is a generic implementation of a game server. It currently uses TCP, but a UDP implementation is in the works. It also includes an example of a Unity client. It is designed to be easy to use and extend. More documentation coming soon.

## Features & Roadmap

- [] Finish roadmap (lol.)
- [x] Basic client that can connect to server.
- [] Send and recieve data between server and client (90% completed)
- [] Implement UDP
- [] More utilities for games in general, and engine-specific utilities.

This is a basic overview. Please file an issue if there's something else I should add!
